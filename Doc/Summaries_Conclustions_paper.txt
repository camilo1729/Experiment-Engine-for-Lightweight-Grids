Toward an Experiment Engine for Lightweight Grids

The goals make an experience correct, reproducible and efficient. Needs in computer power which gives birth a Grid infrastructres. Grid 5000 project, was created to stury large and distributed systemsystems. Running experiments on such a large and distributed machine is a challenge.
The number of nodes.
the different hardware
sorfware configurations
different network topologies are as many parameters that can impact the result of the mesurement. To complex to take into account all the possible parameters


Problematics

*A lot of parameters exists, some tahat users are not awere of, and they can be overlooked. so experiment desings have to accountfor this diversity, while remaining efficient.

*The satus of the platform ca of course be very difficult to grasp because the status of a single node can have a tremendous effect on the results. but interaction form other users via the network can also be disastrous.	

*The experimenter can easily do some things automatically or without thorough checking so experiments become very difficult to reproduce.

*Last but not least, running and supervising an experiment distributed among several clusters is a difficult taks.
